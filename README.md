ARDUPilotPhotoStitcher
======================

Tool to automate the generation of map tiles captured using an ArduPilot drone.

Initial work can be found in "MosaicMaker" folder.

It's state is as follows:
         - A zoomable, panable image viewer
         - Have not yet figured out how to add images in succession
         - Cannot read EXIF GPS data from jpegs yet
         - Based on http://cyotek.com/blog/creating-a-scrollable-and-zoomable-image-viewer-in-csharp-part-1
           and ensuing pages
